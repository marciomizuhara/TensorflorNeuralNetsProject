# Tensorflor Neural Nets Project
This project aims at building a model that attempts to predict whether or not someone will pay back their loan based on historical information.

## Background
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

## Goal
To build a model that predicts whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan based on historical information.

## Required Datasets
We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club. The following should be downloaded and extracted to the project root folder.    
* lending_club_loan_two.csv: the main dataset
* lending_club_info.csv: an info dataset to help out describing the main dataset columns

## Requirements / Libraries
* Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas 
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sklearn
* Tensorflow
* Keras
